    <h1>"Possible solution"</h1>
    <p>In regards the solution of the putting together candidates  which match the selection criteria of Jobs, i would use if/else conditional statement in Javascript. 
        Since i haven't used Javascript in a while now, i will try to describe step by step my thought process. 
        Conditional statement/means that code needs to make decisions, for example:
        If (condition/characteristic) is true {code runs certain response, in this case the response would be - gives candidate 20 points}
        else (condition/characteristic) is not true {you run other code instead, in this case it gives candidate 0 points}.
        And if we want to add more than two values, we are adding it by using else ... if conditon. #
        So if more than two values are true, we will have all points added together. 
        Or if none of the values are true, the outcome (given points will remain 0). 
        So by adding points together the best candidate will be chosen based on how many points they receive. 
        The other aspect would be how equally important specific characteristics are to the emlployer or/and candidate and how flexible they are, but that would be already different added condition as well. 
        


        I believe that solution to given problem is quite similar to fizz buzz game, which i have solved in November last year, you can see my solution as well, which is available in my Github.
