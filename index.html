    <h1>"Possible solution"</h1>
    <p>In regards the solution of the putting together candidates  which match the best the selection criteria, i would use if/else conditional statement in Javascript. 
        Since i haven't used Javascript in a while now, i will try to describe step by step my thought process. 
        Conditional statement/means that code needs to make decisions, for example:
        If (condition/characteristic) is true {code runs certain response, in this case the response would be 20 points}
        else (condition/characteristic) is not true {you run other code instead, in this case 0 points}.
        And if we want to add more than two values, we are adding it by using else ... if conditon. #
        So if more than two values are true, we will have all points added together. 
        Or if none of the values are true, the outcome (given points will remain 0)
        

        
        I believe that solution to given problem is quite similar to fizz buzz game, where you provide the solution based on given values.
